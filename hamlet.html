		<h1>Hamlet, Hypocrisy, and the Case of the Missing Universal Morals</h1>
		<p>
		Noam Chomsky, the linguist and political dissident, describes the principle of moral 
		universalism as, “if an action is right (or wrong) for others, it is right (or wrong) for us” (Chomsky). Chomsky’s political beliefs clearly reveal he believes we should abide by universal principles to judge the morality of actions. This idea is not new. In Hamlet, by William Shakespeare, the first issue that Hamlet considers after posing the famous question, “to be or not to be” (Shakespeare, 3.1.64), is one of morality: is it better to suffer through the problems in your life “Or to take arms against a sea of troubles”? (3.1.67). This question boils down to whether you should accept the way the world is or whether you should fight back to defend universal moral principles. It is challenging to justify fighting for principles if you do not apply them universally. Shakespeare answers Hamlet’s question by showing that Hamlet’s interactions with death and love are fraught with contradictions because the characters do not apply their morals universally.
		<br><br>
		Hamlet suggests that avenging his father’s death would be the way to “take arms against a sea of troubles,” however, by making clear the contradictions inherent in killing Claudius, Shakespeare reveals his true belief that standing up for universal morals and resisting the urge to kill people is a better way to deal with problems in the world (3.1.67). When the ghost of King Hamlet appears before Hamlet, he commands Hamlet to “Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder” (1.5.31). Shakespeare shows the hypocrisy of unequally applied standards with this one line. This line not only tells Hamlet to kill Claudius, but it also describes murder as “foul” and “unnatural.” Talk about hypocrisy - one moment you tell your son to kill someone, and the next moment you say murder is bad. However, the blatant contradictions continue when the ghost further emphasizes the immorality of murder: “Murder most foul, as the best it is” (1.5.33). Here the ghost says that murder, even at its best, is bad. Shakespeare purposefully makes these statements confusing to show that it does not make sense to apply different standards to the same action - which in this case is murder.
		<br><br>
		Shakespeare further shows the need for universal morals when Hamlet provides nonsensical and opposing justifications for why it is bad to commit suicide and why it is bad to kill Claudius. During the “to be or not to be” soliloquy, Hamlet wonders why he suffers through miserable events in his life when he could just kill himself with a dagger: “When he himself might his quietus make / With a bare bodkin?” (3.1.83-90). In the end, he decides it probably is not a great idea to kill himself because he does not know what comes after death. He says, that “dread of something after death...makes us rather bear those ills we have” (3.1.86, 89). Thus it seems Hamlet’s position on why killing himself is not a great idea is clear: there could be something worse after death. However, just two scenes later, Hamlet is on the brink of killing Claudius when he decides to stop because if he kills Claudius while Claudius is praying, Claudius will go “to heaven” (3.3.79). While it is understandable that you might have different reasons for sparing the lives of different people, it is outrageous to have totally different conceptions of what the afterlife is. On the one hand, Hamlet claims what comes after death is unknown when he justifies not committing suicide, and then he says it is a bad idea to kill the king because Claudius might go to heaven. Again, these clear opposing beliefs reveal Shakespeare cannot stand the contradictions inherent to not applying your morals to all people equally.
		<br><br>
		Not all of these moral contradictions appear in relation to death and killing; the need for a clear standard of moral behavior is evident when Hamlet declares unrequited love a terrible thing, yet he purposefully toys with Ophelia’s love for him. Nobody likes unrequited love, Hamlet included. In his “to be or not to be” soliloquy, he includes “The pangs of despised love,” where “despised” means unrequited, as one of the many troubles that make life difficult to bear (3.1.80). His position seems clear: unrequited love is bad. Thus it is especially confusing that right after Hamlet talks about how he hates unrequited love he tells Ophelia that “I did love you once” (3.1.125) and then he immediately follows up with “I loved you not” (3.1.129). Shakespeare is not suggesting that you are a bad person if you realize you do not love someone that you thought you did. However, Hamlet goes beyond that by saying he never loved Ophelia. The contradictions and hypocrisy in these few lines are confusing. This confusion is not only hurtful for Ophelia because it toys with her emotions, but it also shows Shakespeare believes that it is a bad idea to apply different standards to your life than you would to other’s lives.
		The confusing, hypocritical contradictions that arise when Hamlet interacts with death and love are inherent to not following moral universalism. Through all these contradictions, Shakespeare shows he believes this lack of universality is a bad thing, and therefore answers Hamlet’s query about whether one should sit back and accept what comes to you or if you should take a stand “against a sea of troubles” and for an equal application of moral judgements (3.1.67). In our present day we are too willing to always point fingers at “the other” and at bad things in the world just as the ghost points at murder and Hamlet points at unrequited love. However, by only focusing on the evils of others and never on our own, we invite hypocrisy and contradictions into our lives and cannot be taken seriously when pointing out the evils of others. Therefore if we are to have any moral authority as an individual, a group, or a nation, we must hold ourselves accountable to the same moral principles that we hold others to.
