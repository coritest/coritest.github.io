		<h1>The Yemeni Civil War Is a Humanitarian Crisis. And the United States is Making It Worse.</h1>
		<p>
			The State Department claims “a central goal of U.S. foreign policy has been the promotion of respect for human rights.” Respecting human rights is essential to maintain peace and the well being of everyone in the world. However, in the case of the Yemeni Civil War, the United States is not staying true to its values.
			<br><br>
			The Yemeni Civil War, which the New York Times calls “the world’s worst humanitarian crisis,” started in 2014 between a rebel group and the Yemeni military. A coalition led by Saudi Arabia supports the military. In addition to civilian casualties from the fighting, over 500,000 people are suffering from a cholera outbreak due to a scarcity of clean drinking water.
			<br><br>
			The United States supports the Saudi-led coalition with hundreds of billions of dollars worth of weapons as well as logistical and intelligence support. Last year, the Trump Administration agreed to a weapons deal with Saudi Arabia worth $110 billion -- more than UNESCO says is needed to provide everyone in the world with enough water. Trump’s actions are not an anomaly: the Obama Administration’s weapons deals with Saudi Arabia add up to $115 billion.
			<br><br>
			These weapons are in active use. Between 2015 and 2016, Human Rights Watch “found remnants of US-supplied weapons at the site of 23 apparently unlawful coalition airstrikes.”
			<br><br>
			Massive military support for Saudi Arabia is unacceptable. According to the United Nations, between 2015 and 2017 there were nearly 14,000 civilian casualties in Yemen. The Saudi coalition supported by the United States is the “leading cause of civilian casualties and child casualties” in the civil war. 
			<br><br>
			Proponents of U.S. involvement in Yemen claim civilian casualties would be much greater if the United States was not working with Saudi Arabia. But, Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU National Security Project, says, “in so many ways, our government is adding to the devastation and suffering of the Yemeni people.” 
			<br><br>
			The United States should not abet attacks on civilians. A recent report from The Intercept says a U.S. drone killed a 13-year old boy and injured his 19-year-old cousin. The 19-year-old said the charred, mutilated body of his little cousin “was barely recognizable.” Neither of the boys were involved with any terrorist group. In fact, the 19-year-old fights with forces aligned with the United States. When asked about the killing, a Department of Defense spokesperson claimed they “are looking into the matter.”
			<br><br>
			If respecting human rights is a central goal of U.S. foreign policy, the United States needs to cease all weapons sales to Saudi Arabia, encourage a U.N. peace settlement, and bring doctors, medicine, and food supplies to the suffering people of Yemen. Saying that it is “looking into the matter” whenever human rights issues arise is not enough.
